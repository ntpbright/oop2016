# Design Patterns

*Design Patterns* are "reusable" designs for a particular situation.  Each pattern consists of:
* Context - a situation where a design solution is needed
* Forces (or Motivation) - motivation or "needs" of the situation
* Solution - the design that solves the problem
* Consequences - good and back effects of this solution
* Example - each pattern has at least one example of its use

Design Patterns are motivated by some Design Goals and Principles.
Software in general is plagued by:
* change - requirements change, technology changes, the environment where software is used changes
* bugs (errors)
* complexity

These forces have given rise to some *principles* for good design and coding, and some *patterns* for good design.

You can become a better programmer by studying the patterns and principles behind the patterns.

Design Patterns we will study in this course are:

* Adapter - change the iterface of an object
* Command - separate the requester of a behavior from the invoker of the behavior by encapsulating it
* Decorator - add or enhance a behavior without modifying existing classes
* Facade -
* Factory Method - encapsulate object creation and make it polymorphic
* Iterator - a mechanism for iterating over a group of objects without knowing the structure of the group
* Observer - also called Publish - Subscribe
* Singleton - ensure that only one instance of a class is created
* State - change an object's behavior depending on state (without using "if")
* Strategy 
 
The "king" of design patterns is Model-View-Controller (MVC), but its also a bit hard to grasp at first.  We may study it if time permits.

## References to Learn More

There's lots of design patterns material on the web.
I prefer books, though.  Two good books for Java programmers are:

* _Design Patterns Explained_ by Shalloway and Trott.
* _Head First Design Patterns_. Has memorable and entertaining examples, but the example code is too simple.
