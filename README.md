# Topics in Object-Oriented Programming

## Graphics using Swing

Components, layouts, and application design in Swing.  We'll do a simple GUI this week,
and something more advanced later.

Students may also be interested in JavaFX, where component-based interfaces are defined in XML (fxml files) instead of Java code.  This is the way UIs are defined in Android, iOS, and other frameworks.
JavaFX is included with the Java SDK. To visually create user interfaces, also download the
SceneBuilder application.

## Design Patterns

Design Patterns describe useful solutions to common design problems. We will learn how to
identify situations where a design pattern can help, and some of the most common patterns.
Every pattern has an associated *Context*, *Motivation* or "forces" involved,
*Applicability*, and, of course, *Solution* (the design itself).

[UMLD] *UML Distilled*, 3E, by Martin Fowler.  A good, concise book about UML.  Chapter 2 is very good intro to the software development process. In this course we will use class, sequence, and state machine diagrams.
