# Topics in Object-Oriented Programming

## Graphics using Swing

Components, layouts, and application design in Swing.  We'll do a simple GUI this week,
and something more advanced later.

Students may also be interested in JavaFX, where component-based interfaces are defined in XML (fxml files) instead of Java code.  This is the way UIs are defined in Android, iOS, and other frameworks.
JavaFX is included with the Java SDK. To visually create user interfaces, also download the
SceneBuilder application.
