# Graphical UI Programming in Swing

You should know how to:

* create a UI using components including JLabel, JButton, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, and the various text components (TextField, TextArea, TextPane).
* be able to create a designed appearance by using several containers and layout managers.
* know how to set properties of components
* add *Event Listeners* and handle events from components. Event Listeners can validate the values they receive, but don't implement much of the "logic" of your application.  Instead, they should invoke method of other classes.  This is based on the *Single Responsibility Principle* and using a *Layered Design*.
